I am a data geek, aviator, father, husband, and one who easily gets lost in figuring out just about anything.

My personal research focuses on writing self-efficacy and feedback, emotional reactivity, working memory, and various other musings such as creativity and intelligence in the student population. I am also deeply interested in unique quantitative methods, mixtures models, measurement design, machine learning, and longitudinal growth.

All opinions my own.
