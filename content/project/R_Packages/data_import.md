This project is pushing towards the start of a data import package. I have long fought with importing numerous `csv` or `xlsx` files. These functions
work to import them either as a list, for which you can call into an object with `csv$xxxx` or tell the function to make each csv an object on its own.

You'll notice that this GitHub repository is named 'personal.package.' This is a stanging project name that will eventually transition into `ingestR`.
