<p>There is something very satisfying, reassuring, and down-right compelling to making your own data, establishing known paramters, and then seeing how particular methods work to recover them. In graduate school I found this utility increasingly useful in exploring methods and, more importantly, learning them.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1*I_{(group_t=\textit{group2})} + \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$y_t $ is the observed values for the quantitative response variable; <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> goes from 1 to the number of observations in the dataset. Said aother way, this is the outcome, response variable, or what we are trying to predict with the right hand side of the equation.<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the mean response variable when the group is <em>group1</em>. Intercept… where x = 0.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the difference in mean response between the two groups, <em>group2</em> minus <em>group1</em>. If and only if the grouping variable is dichotomous or binary.</li>
<li>The indicator variable, <span class="math inline">\(I_{(group_t=\textit{group2})}\)</span>, is 1 when the group is <em>group2</em> and 0 otherwise, so <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> only affects the response variable for observations in <em>group2</em>. This is why you can look at the intercept to computer the mean of the group that = 0.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> is the random variation present for each observation that is not explained by the group variable. These are assumed to come from an iid normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some shared variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span> This is often called error.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reproducibility, lets grab a seed. Quick fact: If you dont explicitly note a new <code>set.seed(interger here)</code> the seed is created from the current time and process ID from your local? There’s actually a ton of information if you take a look at the help file for <code>set.seed()</code> You’re welcome.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(23120)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s grab some packages/libraries. I use pacman… because just listing a bunch of libraries and hoping you have them installed is pretty rude. Just run the code, it’ll download what you need and not what you don’t.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(&quot;pacman&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;pacman&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: pacman</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,
  tidymodels
)</code></pre>
