<p>There is something very satisfying, reassuring, and down-right compelling to making your own data, establishing known paramters, and then seeing how particular methods work to recover them. In graduate school I found this utility increasingly useful in exploring methods and, more importantly, learning them.</p>

<li>$y_t $ is the observed values for the quantitative response variable; <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> goes from 1 to the number of observations in the dataset<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the mean response variable when the group is <em>group1</em></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the difference in mean response between the two groups, <em>group2</em> minus <em>group1</em>.<br />
</li>
<li>The indicator variable, <span class="math inline">\(I_{(group_t=\textit{group2})}\)</span>, is 1 when the group is <em>group2</em> and 0 otherwise, so <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> only affects the response variable for observations in <em>group2</em></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> is the random variation present for each observation that is not explained by the group variable. These are assumed to come from an iid normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some shared variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span></li>
