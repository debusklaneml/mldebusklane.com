<p>Coming off of the wild excursion of getting Python markdown through RStudio’s knitr (which didnt really work out well… I just exported a Jupyter Lab markdown and arranged it through my Hugo build), this is a brief vantage of how we might write the sudoku puzzle solver in the R language. Here we go.</p>
<p>Using the basic sudoku puzzle from wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">HERE</a>, we’ll start to build this out.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debusklaneml/mldebusklane.com/master/content/post/Random_Code/sudoku.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></a></p>
<p>Using the same input methods as the python version (<a href="https://www.mldebusklane.com/post/random_code/sudoku/">here</a>)</p>
<p>Lets bring in the actual board…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>board &lt;- c(5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,
          6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0,
          0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0,
          8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3,
          4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1,
          7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,
          0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,
          0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5,
          0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9)</code></pre>
<p>First, it’s important to push this into a matrix.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>board &lt;- matrix(board, nrow = 9, ncol = 9, byrow = TRUE) </code></pre>
<p>Next, lets develop the code to render each cell’s possible answers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>possible &lt;- function(board, i, j){
  # Creates an all TRUE logical vector
  possible &lt;- rep(TRUE,9)
  # Lists all known numbers from the row, column, and 3x3 cell
  selected_num &lt;- unique(c(board[i,], board[,j], board[3*((i-1) %/% 3) + 1:3, 3*((j-1) %/% 3) + 1:3]))
  # Removes NAs
  selected_num &lt;- na.omit(selected_num)
  # Changes the logical vector to FALSE for all values currently in use for the row, column, and 3x3 cell
  possible[selected_num] &lt;- FALSE
  # Returns this logical vector for use in subsequent functions...
  return(possible)
}</code></pre>
<p>As the comments imply, we are simply returning a logical vector list that describes which numbers are available or <code>possible</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll draft the function to iterate through all cells and determine a solution through recursion.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The &#39;board&#39; argument here provides the matrix, length 81 (9x9), to iterate through. 
# The &#39;progress&#39; argument here provides a starting value to recursively iterate through. 
solve &lt;- function(board, progress = 81) {
  # Provision to make a matrix with 0s into NA for future processing
  if  (0 %in% board) {
    board[board == 0] &lt;- NA
  } else board
  # Once all cells have been assessed within the &#39;possible_choices&#39; function, it stops the recursion. 
  if (progress == 0) {
    # Successfully filled in the board
    return(board)
  }
  # Get the i,j coordinates
  # A fancy way to iterate through the coordinate numbers one by one (right to left, bottom to top)
  i &lt;- ((progress - 1) %% 9) + 1 
  j &lt;- ((progress - 1) %/% 9) + 1 
  # If a spot is open, identifies what numbers are available `choices`
  if (is.na(board[i, j])) {
    choices &lt;- which(possible(board, i, j))
  } else{
    choices &lt;- c(board[i, j])
  }
  # Try each possible choice, until all the requirements of the two functions are satisfied. 
  for (k in choices) {
    board[i, j] &lt;- k
    # recursion
    answer &lt;- solve(board, progress - 1)
    # If all possible positions have been completed, simply return the answer. 
    if (!is.null(answer)) {
      return(answer)
    }
  }
  return(NULL)
}</code></pre>
<p>Although there is a lot going on here, I’ve attempted to put in some fairly descriptive comments. I tried to follow the Python code thematic plan, while using some of R’s fantastic infix operators to skip a few steps here or there and a bit of recursion. You’ll also note that I also switch all zeros to NAs, to make things a bit easier to code using <code>is.na</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>solve(board)</code></pre>
